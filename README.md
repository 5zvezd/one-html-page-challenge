# One HTML Page Challenge

The goal is to create anything you want within 1 single html file. Practice your skills with no assistance from libraries, no separation of files, and no assistance of a modern framework. **How creative can you be with such restrictions?**

## Rules
 - You must write all of your code in 1 single HTML file.
 - Your file must be less than 10kb (measured by the file size on github).
 - You cannot import any external files (this will be checked by looking at the network tab in chrome).
 
## How to Submit
 1. Fork the repository.
 2. Add your html file to the `/entries` directory.
 3. Edit the `entries.js` file in the root, with your information for the entry.
 4. Commit to your forked repo.
 5. Make a pull request to master from your forked repo.
 
 _* You may submit as many entries as you'd like._
